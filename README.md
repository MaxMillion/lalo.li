please look in the different files for licensing details (of the scripts and the libs)

if not mentioned otherwise (in the files) the license is MIT and/or GPL and/or LGPL (think this is called co-co-licensing).

ok, how does this work
  
  * the speak functionality is thx to <a href="https://github.com/kripken">kripkens</a> awesome <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">emscripten</a> compiled <a href="https://github.com/kripken/speak.js">speak.js</a>
  * the knobs thx to the awesome <a href="https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob">knob jquery</a> lib

glued together by memyselfandi franz enzenhofer (follow me on  <a href="http://twitter.com/enzenhofer">twitter</a> if you like)

where does it work (for sure)

 * chrome - mac
 * firefox - mac

tested on opera (mac) and safari (mac), too. does not work there (on safari due to lack of typedarrays i think, in opera due to a strange webworker bug) 

not tested on windows or any version of IE. (a few weeks ago i wasted days (days!!!) fixing the windows vista installation of a friend, it was the most stupid, most horrible IT experience i had for years. i will never touch a microsoft machine ever again, ever!!!!)   


where and how was this coded

 * bolivia - with a shitty internet connection, that's probably why it's 100% client side. (limited ressources lead to clever decisions. i'm a huge fan of limited ressources)
 * the idea came to me after 6 month of south america travel (with backpacks and family)
 * took me about 2 and 1/2 days
 * emacs
 * coffeescript





p.s.: i'm currently looking for an no b*llshit whole stack webperformance optimization guy for some freelance work. please contace me. office (at) franz - enzenhofer . com
